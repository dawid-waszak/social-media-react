<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

![Game Screen Shot][Pulse_img]

This is my first biggest fullstack application. I have created my REST api in Node.js for fetching data from MongoDB database. <br/>
Application has multiple functionalities:

 * login and registration pages (checking for proper style, min. characters, etc...),
 * user session is created for one hour after login (after one hour user is logged out),
 * friends request section (for now in this sections is showed every user from database, who is not your friend),
 * post section (you can create posts and see posts of your friends),
 * friends section (here you will see all of your friends).
